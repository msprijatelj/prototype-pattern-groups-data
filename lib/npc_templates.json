    "description": "The galaxy is littered with beings that do not conform to humanity’s interpretation of reality. While not all merit the categorization of MONIST, these anomalies challenge what we understand about the very nature of the universe.<br/><br/>Encountering one of these entities is often a life-changing experience in the worst of ways. God help you if you do.<br/><br/>Anomalies interact with the battlefield and their opponents in uncanny ways. Their influence upon reality lingers upon their targets, rewriting their victims’ very natures. Use this template to grant an NPC unconventional controller-like abilities and unsettling effects that require player adaptation to overcome.",
