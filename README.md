# Prototype Pattern Groups

This repository contains the JSON data for Lancer third-party supplement [Prototype Pattern Groups](https://valkyrion.itch.io/prototype-pattern-groups). It can be used to construct an LCP for [COMP/CON](https://compcon.app/).

If using Foundry VTT, I recommend the mod [Lancer PPG Structure](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/reCaste-PPG-structure) to automate the alternative Structure and Overheating rules featured in this project.
